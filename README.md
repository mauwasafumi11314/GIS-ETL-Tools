# **GIS ETL automation tool **

## **Overview**

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to automate GIS workflows using Python. It includes tools for:
1. Extracting and loading spatial data (shapefiles, GeoJSON, and raster files) into an ArcGIS and save their attribute tables as excel/csv files in each sub holder.
2. Automating the loading of shapefiles into a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database.

## **Features**

### **1. Load Spatial Data into a Geodatabase**
- Load all spatial data (shp, tif, geojson) from a folder onto a new geodatabase.
- Extract attribute tables from shapefiles and save the tables in another geodatabase
- Export attribute tables as excel and csv files in each of their own sub fold

### **2. Load Spatial Data into PostgreSQL/PostGIS**
- Extract and load into a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database.
